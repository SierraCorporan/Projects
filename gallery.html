        <h2>Raster Image</h2>
        <img src="images/SierraCorporan_Selfie.jpeg" alt="composition of myself and my world"
        width="600px">
        <p> I created this Raster Image in Adobe Photoshop using different images and putting them together to create one composition. This image shows a picture of myself and im surrounded by things that make me who i am. That consists of Artwork, Photography from places i might visit as well as gaming objects.I enjoy gaming,traveling, and creating artwork in my free time so this is what i believe contributes to who i am as a person. </p>
        
         <h2> GIF Animation</h2>
        <img src="images/Untitled-Artwork.GIF"
             alt="humorous gif of someone neing hit with a canonball"
             width="550px">
        <p> To create this GIF Animation I used the software Procreate. The software has an easy applicable animation guide that I was able to use to draw each panel of my animation. The key to this project was learning how to make the GIF smoother as it plays, and I was able to learn that the more panels the smoother it plays.The scene shows someone shooting through a canonball and the ball coming back and hitting the person straight in the head while they are unaware.

        <h2>Vector Image</h2>
        <img src="images/SierraCorporan_vector600px.png"
             alt="composition of myself and my world"
        width="450px">
        <p>I created a sweet smiling potted plant. Illustrator was one of my favorite applications to work in and i feel this piece represents plants, something I love with a welcoming smile.</p>
        
        
        
        <h2> My Artwork </h2>
        <img src="images/IMG-5183.jpg"
             alt="a drawing of a bouquet of sunflowers"
        width="600px">
        
        <img src="images/IMG-1164.JPG"
             alt="a drawing of a half a tiger and a half a tiger skull"
             width="600px">
        
        <img src="images/IMG-0710.jpg"
             alt="a drawing of a girl besides a lit candle"
        width="600px">
        <p>This is a small series of some Artwork ive created over the past year or so. Using Colored Pencils and Graphite I was able to creat compositions that all represnt more or less Life and Death. This collection is a small portion of my highschool portfolio but its some of my strongest and favorite pieces as well.</p>
        
        <h2>My Relaxed 10-sec animation</h2>

        <p> My first time cresting an Animation using Adobe After Effects was definitely a challenge but I was so happy with the result. For this assignment I chose the emotion "Relaxed" and created a video using soft curves and movements to represent that relaxed feeling</p>
        
        <h2>Programming with p5</h2>
        <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/scorporan04/full/Z5esPx7AO" width="600px" height="400px"> </iframe>
        <p> Using P5 was a fun experience. I think with all of the assignments it was hard at first to grasp the new subject and proccess how to actually create but after playing with the colors and shapes I was able to create a piece of triangles with pink circles.</p>
