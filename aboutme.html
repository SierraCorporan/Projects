          <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> My name is Sierra Corporan, and I am currently a freshman in my first year of college!  In my free time I enjoy drawing, baking, reading, and gaming. I major in Multimedia Arts and Programming and as far as my experience has been so far it's been challenging but has definitely made me much more Independent and able to discover my interests. I am 18 years of age and my ethnicity is Hispanic. I have many about 8 siblings and life is a little complicated, but we will get through it. Likewise, I've lived in New York City all of my life, but my dream is to travel. As an aspiring Concept Artist, I want to be able to create artwork in different parts of the world and take inspiration from places I visit.</p>
        <p>I have been interested in the Arts all of my life, and in high school I had the opportunity to major in both Graphic Design and Illustration. At first, I was more directly into drawing by hand and creating illustrations that I found beautiful and enjoyed, but as I grew and time passed I realized the arts not only have so many different categories, but I was also interested in technology and conceptual art. Having had the opportunity to be introduced to arts in technology in high school made it very obvious to me that was what I wanted to do with my future. I'm not 100 percent sure when ill get there or if I'm even on the correct path yet, but I'm enjoying learning these new programs and skills that could make me a much stronger Concept Artist than if I didn't.</p>
